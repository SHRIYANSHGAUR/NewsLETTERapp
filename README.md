# NewsLETTER app

This is a News LETTER  Sign-UP page that I created as a CODE-CHALLENGE during my WEB-Development Course 
In it I have used Mailchimp to collect the Name and EMAIL address of the customers who would like to sign up
I have also used BOOTSTRAP framework to create RESPONSIVE APP that follows MOBILE-FIRST paradigmn
It is currently deployed on Heroku PLatform
